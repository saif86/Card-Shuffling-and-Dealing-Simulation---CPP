# Card-Shuffling-and-Dealing-Simulation---CPP
High-Performance Card-Shuffling and Dealing Simulation using C++

The attached code is taken from C++ How to program by Deitel & Deitel, 4th Edition, Chapter 18, Page No. 1005.

## Example : High-Performance Card-Shuffling and Dealing Simulation

Write a program that is based on the card-shuffling and dealing simulation. The program should represent the deck of cards as an array of structures and use high-performance shuffling and dealing algorithms.
